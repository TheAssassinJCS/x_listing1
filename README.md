# 🏠 App Details

This app was a test to see how fast i can adapt from C# to learn a new Library - in just a few months i learned C#-Xamarin.
With that i tested it to create an application for a bussiness to add their clients to a list that they can add comments so every bussiness can know 
what other businesses got from other clients.

#

# Why

This app was someting i wanted to create to test my own skill working with lists and how they interact with each other when you add single instances 
as items in the lists. This i found difficult but found a way to make it work and it worked.

#

This app was developed in Xamarin and C#. Android and IOS can be supported the only thing is i only had the equipment to create it for the Android.
